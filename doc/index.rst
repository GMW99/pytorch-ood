PyTorch Out-of-Distribution Detection
#############################

This package provides implementation of methods and helper functions for Out-of-Distribution Detection based on PyTorch.
PyTorch-OOD aims to provide modular, well-tested, and documented implementations of OOD detection methods with a unified
interface, as well as training and benchmark datasets, pre-trained models, and utility functions.

This documentation provides a user guide with general information on the
assumptions, nomenclature, as well as a structured API documentation to aid implementation.
