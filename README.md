Python utilities to bootstrap research in fields related to Out-of-Distribution Detection, Open-Set Recognition,
Novelty Detection and Anomaly Detection based on Neural Networks (with PyTorch).

This package provides

- Loss Functions
- Detection Methods
- Datasets commonly used for evaluation
- Neural Network Architectures commonly used in papers
- Useful Utilities

Is provided in the hope to speed up research and to facilitate reproducibility.


## Setup

### Optional Dependencies
For OpenMax, you will have to install `libmr`, which is currently broken.
You will have to install `cython` and `libmr` afterwards by manually.
